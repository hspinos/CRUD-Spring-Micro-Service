# Restful-Spring-Boot-Microservice
A simple RESTful spring boot microservice that connects to a mySQL database.

# Goals for Project
    - Gain experience using Spring Boot and improve overall understanding of microservices
    - Increase familiarity with REST API endpoints in a different language (JAVA)
    - Understand a commonly seen microservice architechture (Controller, Service, Repository)
    - Docker

#Docker
    The end goal is to use docker compose to create two containers, one for the Spring Boot
    application and one for the mySQL database. The two will work together to handle http requests
    sent to the application through Postman.
